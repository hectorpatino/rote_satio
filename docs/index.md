# Welcome to MkDocs

Welcome to `rote_satio`'s documentation! This documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), 
a static site generator that's geared towards project documentation.

This simple package (for now) is a collection of tools and models for the analysis of satellite imagery.
The main idea of the package is to work with seamlessly with `xarray`, `scikit-learn`, and `spyndex` and `feature-engine`
for the analysis of satellite imagery.

Please notice that `rote_satio` is still in its early stages of development, so expect some bugs and changes in the API.
